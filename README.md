# Lomb-Scargle periodograms for astropy

This repository contains an implementation of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram for
use with [astropy](http://astropy.org). The implementation is based on the
[gatspy](http://astroml.org/gatspy/) package, but is enhanced to work within
the ``astropy.units`` framework.
